still WIP, too. 
### Instructions:
- `label` - defines a label to which you can jump
- `let` - creates/sets the value of a variable, You can use `{1,2,3}`.. to define arrays,
`&var` to create a reference, `*var` to set to the same value as different variable and you can ofcourse also create booleans, scalars and strings
